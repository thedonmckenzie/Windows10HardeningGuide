# Credential Caching

        Write-Host "Credential caching" -ForegroundColor Yellow

    # Cached credentials are stored in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database and can allow a user to log onto a workstation they have 
    # previously logged onto even if the domain is not available. Whilst this functionality may be desirable from an availability of services perspective, 
    # this functionality can be abused by an adversary who can retrieve these cached credentials (potentially Domain Administrator credentials in a worst-case scenario). To reduce this risk, cached credentials should be limited to only one previous logon.

        Write-Host "Allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication has been disabled" -ForegroundColor Green

    # Within an active user session, credentials are cached within the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process 
    # (including the userâ€™s passphrase in plaintext if WDigest authentication is enabled) to allow for access to network resources 
    # without users having to continually enter their credentials. Unfortunately, these credentials are at risk of theft by an adversary. 
    # To reduce this risk, WDigest authentication should be disabled.

    # Controlled Folder Access is a security feature in Microsoft Windows 10 version 1709 that forms part of Windows Defender Exploit Guard. 
    # It is designed to combat the threat of ransomware. In order to use Controlled Folder Access, Windows Defender Antivirus must be configured 
    # as the primary real-time antivirus scanning engine on workstations. Other third party antivirus solutions may offer similar functionality as 
    # part of their offerings. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-exploit-guard/controlled-folders-exploit-guard

# Credential Entry

        Write-Host "Credential Entry" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    # When users enter their credentials on a workstation it provides an opportunity for malicious code, such as a key logging application, 
    # to capture the credentials. To reduce this risk, users should be authenticated by using a trusted path to enter their credentials on the Secure Desktop.        
    # Dont display network selection UI  
        Set-ItemProperty -Path "Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System" -Name DontDisplayNetworkSelectionUI -Value 1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
