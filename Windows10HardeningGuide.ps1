    # An adversary that develops exploits for Microsoft Windows or third party applications will have a higher success rate when security measures designed 
    # by Microsoft to help prevent security vulnerabilities from being exploited are not implemented. Windows Defender Exploit Guardâ€™s Exploit Protection functionality 
    # was introduced in Microsoft Windows 10 version 1709 to provide system-wide and application-specific security measures. Exploit Protection is designed to replace the 
    # Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) that was used on earlier versions of Microsoft Windows 10.
    # System-wide security measures configurable via Exploit Protection include: Control Flow Guard (CFG), Data Execution Prevention (DEP), mandatory Address Space Layout 
    # Randomization (ASLR), bottom-up ASLR, Structured Exception Handling Overwrite Protection (SEHOP) and heap corruption protection. Many more application-specific security 
    # measures are also available.
